The Industrial Revolution fundamentally transformed European society between 1760 and 1840. What began in Britain's textile mills eventually spread across the continent, reshaping not just manufacturing but the very fabric of daily life. Historians continue to debate whether this transformation was primarily driven by technological innovation or by broader economic and social forces.

Consider the cotton industry, which saw productivity increase by roughly 500 percent during this period. James Hargreaves' spinning jenny, patented in 1770, allowed a single worker to operate eight spindles simultaneously. Yet the machine itself was not enough; it required capital investment, available labor, and access to raw materials from colonial trade networks.

The social consequences were equally profound. Rural populations migrated to industrial centers like Manchester and Birmingham, creating new urban challenges. Housing conditions deteriorated as workers crowded into hastily constructed tenements. Public health crises, including cholera outbreaks in the 1830s, forced governments to reconsider their laissez-faire approaches to urban planning.

Some scholars, following Eric Hobsbawm, emphasize the hardships faced by the working class during this transition. Others, like Joel Mokyr, point to the long-term improvements in living standards that industrialization eventually brought. Both perspectives contain important truths that complicate any simple narrative of progress or decline.

What remains clear is that the Industrial Revolution created the template for modern economic development. The patterns established in 18th-century Britain — mechanization, urbanization, capital accumulation — would repeat across continents over the following two centuries.
